To run the program you will need to first do 'npm install' to install the dependencies. Then you will need to change the database connection details within the index.js depending on your db.

To install the db we have the 'gameDB.sql' file which will create the DB and the tables. After which you can use the .csv files to pollute the tables with data.

Finally run 'npm start' and the web app will run on your browser.
